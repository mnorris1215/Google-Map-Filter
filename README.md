# INTRODUCTIONS

Thank you for taking the time to review this project. This repository is centered around the the Google Maps API, which
includes rendering markers from imported data, a custom heatmap, and various filters. I am happy with the functionality and
I hope you may find some practical ways to use this.



# THINGS TO IMPROVE

Framework?

Vue.js will be the main framework for this site. Admittedly, I have had no prior experience with creating and working with API
calls. Therefore, I am happy that I am able to create one with Vanilla Js, which can be integrated into Vue. I am
comfortable with the Vue framework, so learning how to successfully call an API and importing necessary data within the
framework is a task that I am currently enjoying.




Styling?

I plan to use the Element Desktop UI Vue library for pre-defined styling rules. Once the project is integrated in Vue, styling
will quickly follow.




API Key Vunerability?

Vue offers a way to keep an API key secret during production. I am sure that there is a plain JavaScript way to achieve this as well, and is one of the lessons along the learning curve.





So, when are you going to finish this?

This project will be complete before September 22, 2019.
